# Crowdfunding_ETL
This project involves practicing building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the provided data. 
We transformed the data, created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema.
Finally, we uploaded the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
